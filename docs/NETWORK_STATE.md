# Our own Ubi.com: where this stands, and what is known

A companion to [NETWORK.md](NETWORK.md), which explains how the game finds its
servers. This one is the state of play: what runs, what the client accepted, what
it refused, and where the next wall is. Written 12.08.2026 so that none of it has
to be recovered from memory.

## How to run it

```bash
node tools/net-server.ts          # all our services, one process, logs to _tmp/net/
```

Then start the game from the copy: `C:\Projects\homm5-game-net\run-net.bat`. That
bat sets `http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080`, which is the whole redirect — the
game's libcurl asks us for its server list instead of `gsconnect.ubisoft.com`.
Nothing in the exe is patched for this.

Two logs matter, and they answer different questions:

| log | says |
|---|---|
| `_tmp/net/session-*.log` | every byte in and out of our services, decoded |
| `<game copy>/bin/homm5-editor-*.log` | **the game's own narration**, mirrored by our DLL |

The second one is the important one and it exists because of
[native/net/ubi-log.c](../native/net/ubi-log.c): one detour on the engine's log
append (0xDFB270), lines stamped with a tick count. Build it with
`node tools/build-native.ts --log net/ubi-log` and install with
`node tools/install-native.ts --game C:\Projects\homm5-game-net`. Without it we are
blind — five walls in a row were found by reading it, and the two before it cost a
launch each to guess at.

`node tools/net-decode.ts --file <dump>` turns a hex dump from either log back
into a message; `--srp` for a datagram, `--irc` for chat.
`node tools/net-probe.ts <exe> …` is the disassembly side: strings, references,
imports, callers, `--func`, `--dword`, `--bytes`.

## The ports, and who answers

```
8080   HTTP        the server list (this is the whole redirect)
40000  Router      key exchange, LOGIN, JOINWAITMODULE
40001  RouterWM    the wait module: LOGINWAITMODULE, PLAYERINFO, PROXY_HANDLER, LOBBY_MSG
40010  NAT   UDP   the address mirror
40020  CDKey UDP   challenge / activation / authorisation / validation — all yes
40030  Proxy       where "persistantdata" and "ladderquery" live
40031  ProxyWM     the proxy's own wait module
40040  Lobby       LOBBYSERVERLOGIN, channels, rooms
6667   IRC         chat, and a precondition for entering a channel
```

The four GS desks (router, its wait module, proxy, proxy's wait module) speak one
protocol with three differences, all in `src/net/router-service.ts`; the lobby is
a fourth role on the same code.

## How far the client gets

Everything below is from the game's own log, not inference:

```
server list        -> ours
NAT init           -> "connected to NAT Service server 127.0.0.1:40010"
CD-key             -> challenge, authorisation, validation: all answered yes
router             -> keys, LOGIN, "iam sent to 40001"
wait module        -> LOGINWAITMODULE, PLAYERINFO, PROXY_HANDLER
proxy chain        -> LOGIN, hand-off, LOGINWAITMODULE on 40031, LOGINFRIENDS
lobby login        -> accepted, three channels pushed
IRC                -> "IRC welcome", "IRC join channel succeeded"
join channel       -> "join lobby succeeded(GroupID=1,LobbySrvID=1)"
NAT address        -> "address request succeeded,address=1.0.0.127:40010"
ladder             -> query 1281 answered, a row at 1500 for a new player
create game        -> CREATE_ROOM answered, room 100 in the channel
join own room      -> "LobbyRcv_RoomInfo", then CStateInRoom / CStateWaitingForPlayers
settings changes   -> GROUP_CONFIG_UPDATE_RES answered, the room echoed back
```

So a player logs in, enters a channel, hosts a game and **sits in it waiting for
players**. What has never been tried is a second client — which is also the only way
the rest of the protocol can be reached.

## Facts worth not re-learning

- **The checksum's lone odd byte is SIGNED.** The routine is at 0x4796E0: the seed is
  written into the checksum field, an odd-length segment counts its first byte alone
  and `movsx`-extended, the rest as 16-bit words. During verification that byte IS
  the seed's low byte, and the client picks a random seed per connection — so with
  `>= 0x80` our sum was 256 too high and the datagram was dropped **without a word**.
  Our NAT answer is 43 bytes, odd, so every launch was a coin toss and it landed at a
  different step each time. This is the source of every "it worked, then it didn't"
  in this file's history, and it means the NAT answer table in `src/net/nat-service.ts`
  may have been measuring the seed rather than the subtypes.
- **A room is twenty fields, a channel is fourteen**, and that is how the client tells
  a game from a channel: sent in the channel's shape our room was logged as
  `LobbyRcv_NewLobby` and then refused. The six extra are visitors, both version
  strings, and the host's two addresses.
- **A mask in a reply must be the mask the request carried.** JOIN_ROOM asks with 448
  (all three "tell me about it" bits), JOIN_LOBBY with 384. The mask says what the
  rest of the message contains; answered with a narrower one the client says "join
  room succeeded" and then "join room failed, no such room in internal list".
- **The ids inside the host's settings blob are ours to write.** He composes it before
  the room exists, so both say -1 (`02 08 ff ff ff ff 03 08 ff ff ff ff`); the server
  stamps the room id and the lobby server id in. Everything else passes through.
- **Order matters: the room info goes out BEFORE the acceptance.** The client
  dispatches in arrival order, so given the "yes" first it runs
  `ProcessJoinRoomReply` against a list that is still empty.
- **Never invent a member's player-info blob.** The client branches on its length
  (0xDFCDEB): with bytes there it parses them, with none it falls back to the name
  field of the member record. A blob of our own parsed into nothing — "member joined
  game (Name=,ExtIP=0.0.0.0:0)". Send his own (from SET_PLAYER_INFO) or nothing.
- **A member list is read as an arrival.** Answering a settings update with the room
  AND its members made the client announce a phantom join, which is a change, which is
  another settings update — five a second, with the game's settings blob growing each
  round because each phantom arrival added a player to it.
- **An address in a message body is a decimal u32**, and which order depends on
  the field. The wait-module hand-off wants HOST order (`2130706433`); the NAT
  answer wants `inet_addr` order (`16777343`). Both were measured by watching the
  game's sockets — a dotted string sent it to `0.0.0.127`, the wrong number to
  `1.0.0.127`.
- **The client's log prints a network-order address octet-reversed.** Its
  "address=1.0.0.127:40010" is how it renders 127.0.0.1. Reading that as an error
  and turning the bytes round broke a step that already worked, twice. See the
  table in `src/net/nat-service.ts`.
- **The NAT answer that works is subtypes 1, 2 and 3 together**, `inet_addr`
  order, the mirror's own port, request id echoed. Two subtypes failed; one
  subtype failed; one subtype twice failed. Why three is not understood.
- **A step that is not answered costs 30 seconds** — the `0x1E` handed to the NAT
  connect — and then the client moves on or starts over. That is the lag Сеня
  noticed, and it is why a wrong answer looks like a hang rather than an error.
- **The login arrives GS_ENCRYPT, keyed with the key WE generated**, not the one
  the client sent us.
- **Chat is real IRC in a wrapper** (u16 big-endian length, Blowfish on a key in
  the exe) and entering a channel depends on it: the client joins
  `#LobbyGrp<lobby>.<server>` and only then asks for its address.
- **The client reads our game list and enforces unique names.** Its default game
  name comes from the player's own, so a stale room of his own makes "a game with
  this name already exists". Rooms now die with their host's connection, on
  GROUP_LEAVE, and a host recreating his own game replaces it.
- **Both engine log thresholds are already 0.** Lowering them opens branches the
  engine means to skip and it dies in its own string append. Read, do not write.
- The blob in CREATE_ROOM (555–888 bytes, it grows with the map) is the host's own
  description of the game — map path, rules, goal — and it passes through us with only
  the two ids written into it.
- **`net-probe "<text>"` matches a whole literal, not a substring.** The engine's names
  live inside longer ones (`LobbySend_Login(`, `…LadderQueryRcv_RequestReply: `), so
  asking for the bare name answers "no such string" about strings that are plainly
  there. That false negative nearly got a correct document rewritten into a wrong one.
  When a name is not found, dump the neighbourhood: `--strings <from> <to>`.
- **A log line can be mostly canned.** The RoomInfo line ends with a literal run of
  seventeen commas, so the "empty fields" in it are not evidence of anything.

## Addresses in the exe worth keeping

Ours is `bin/H5_Game_H5E.exe`, image base 0x400000, read with `tools/net-probe.ts` in
the editor repo.

| what | where |
|---|---|
| SRP checksum (the signed odd byte) | 0x4796E0 |
| SRP receive: length check, then connection lookup **by signature** | 0x47CB00 |
| SRP header builder (`or edx,3040h`) / segment send | 0x479740 / 0x47BB20 |
| the ladder request, pushed beside `"ladderquery"` | 0x42BC92 |
| `ProcessGetLadderRow` — asks, then enumerates the reply | 0xE0BBB0 |
| member's blob: the branch on its length, and the parser | 0xDFCDEB / 0xDFE850 |
| `ProcessMemberJoined` (its own log lines are the oracle) | 0xDFCBE0 |
| the servers-config fetch, and why an error code names no step | 0xE07A50 / 0xE075B1 |

## Where the next wall is

**The second player, and it is the whole of the gap.** Everything a lone host can do,
he does; nothing has asked for START_GAME because starting needs somebody to start
against. What the second client sends is the specification, so there is nothing to
design in advance — but there are three things to prepare and one open question.

To prepare:

- **A second player's member record.** Only his own connection knows his player-info
  blob (`RouterSession.playerInfo`); every other member is currently sent with an empty
  one, which is a name and no address. Two players in a room means each has to see the
  other's, so that blob has to live with the player rather than the session.
- **Arrivals must be announced to the people already there.** Our replies only ever go
  back to whoever asked. `MEMBER_JOIN` (50) exists for that, and so does `NEW_GROUP`
  (54) for a game appearing in a channel somebody else is looking at.
- **The peers' addresses.** The lobby knows each player's own (`LOBBYSERVERLOGIN`
  reports his LAN address and netmask) and the NAT mirror knows how he looks from
  outside; the port his pings come from is 8888. That is the material for introducing
  them, and gameplay itself is peer to peer, so this server never carries it.

The open question: **does one install run twice**, or is a second copy of the game
folder needed? Worth answering before anything else, because it decides how the test
is even set up.

**Starting is a chain of five, not one message.** From the client's own RTTI:

```
CStateWaitingForPlayers      -- SFLB_AttemptGameStart, once the room is full enough
  -> LobbySend_GameStart     CStateWaitStartGameReply    <- LobbyRcv_StartGameReply
                             CStateWaitGameStarted       <- LobbyRcv_GameStarted
  -> LobbySend_GameReady     CStateWaitGameReadyReply    <- LobbyRcv_GameReadyReply
  -> LobbySend_StartMatch    CStateWaitStartMatchReply   <- LobbyRcv_StartMatchReply
      ... the game is played, peer to peer ...
  -> LobbySend_SubmitMatchResult  CStateWaitSubmitMatchResultReply
                             CStateWaitFinalMatchResults <- LobbyRcv_FinalMatchResults
```

Every `CStateWait*` is its own 30-second stall if unanswered, and `GameStarted` is
a push to the other players rather than a reply to the sender. The first sender is
`NUbi::CStateWaitingForPlayers::ProcessGameStart` (0xE1C9C0), which hands off to the
GS library at 0x4196F0 — that is where the subtype numbers live if the wire does not
show them.

**The ladder is answered, and its row layout is the open guess.** `PROXY_HANDLER`
subtype 1281 (0x501) now gets a real row from `src/net/ladder.ts` — 46 keys, a new
player at 1500, stored in `data/ladder.json`. What is measured: the request's shape and
that the reply's first field is read as a byte and compared with 0x26 (38). What is
guessed: how a row is laid out. The verdict is one line in the game's log —
`LadderQuery_StartResultEntryEnumeration(…) succeeded` against `ladder query request
failed,reason=…` — so read that before changing anything about it.
[LADDER.md](LADDER.md) has the rest, including the four handler names behind the proxy.

**Chat has no history and cannot get one from the protocol.** It is real IRC: a joiner
gets an echo of his JOIN and a member list, nothing else. Replaying the last N lines
to him is possible — the client draws whatever arrives, and it packs colour and font
into the message text itself — but it is our invention, and replayed lines will look
like they were just said, because the wire carries no timestamps.

Accounts are still "any name, any password". The client has no registration
screen (`UI/MPRegister` is the progress window), but the wire has
`NEWUSERREQUEST` and the client knows how to say "name taken" and "wrong
password", so creating an account on first login needs no client change —
Сеня chose that over a website or a new screen. Removing the CD-key prompt is still
open too: the key sits in the client's `ubi_cdkey` setting, used by the screens at
0x87B790, 0x87C840, 0x87CF50, 0x87D2B0.
